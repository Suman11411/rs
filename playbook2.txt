Shell Script
1 # Install Apache. 
2 yum install --quiet -y httpd httpd-devel 
3 # Copy configuration files. 
4 cp /path/to/config/httpd.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 
5 cp /path/to/config/httpd-vhosts.conf /etc/httpd/conf/httpd-vhosts.conf 
6 # Start Apache and configure it to run at boot. 
7 service httpd start 
8 chkconfig httpd on

To run the shell script (in this case, a file named shell-script.sh with the contents as above), you would call it directly from the command line:

# (From the same directory in which the shell script resides). 
$ ./shell-script.sh


vi playbook.yml
